Grouping

What level of the directory hierarchy to group the images by. This is used to group images by well, plate, etc.
0: no grouping, all images should be aggregated into single tensors stored at the root of the dataset directory
1: group by well, images will be aggregated into the first level of subdirectories
etc.
If you want the grouping to be at the individual image level, select -1

Channel Specification

channels
The names of the channels as they will appear in the dataset directory folders ie {channel}.png
This will be saved after you set it for the first time, so you only need to set it once.

cmaps
The colormaps to use for each channel. These are the names of the colormaps in the microfilm package.
Normally pure_{color} works fine.

dapi, tubl, calb2
The indices of the channels that correspond to DAPI, Tubulin, and Calb2 respectively in the channels
array. If you don't have calb2, set it to None. The others must be set to integers.
These are used by the segmentation code to feed in the correct channels to the segmentation model.
